NPX vs NPM
npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (since version 5.2.0). It simplifies the use of CLI tools and other executables hosted on the npm registry by:

Running Executables: Allows you to run executables without installing them globally.
Temporary Installation: Downloads and runs a package temporarily if it's not already installed.
Avoiding Global Installs: Reduces the need for globally installing packages, helping to avoid version conflicts and unnecessary clutter
npx -p @angular/cli ng new <project-name>
